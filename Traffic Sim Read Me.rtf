\f0\fs24 \cf0 For each of these simulations, we were tasked with giving different conditions for probability of a car arriving at the light, the speed with which they traversed the intersection, etc. Each program operates independently of each other and displays the results of the simulation by listing out the number of cars which arrived at the light and the percentage of time spent in the intersection.}
